### How It Works

1. **AI Agent Connection** - Claude, GPT, or other MCP-compatible agents connect via FastMCP protocol
2. **Intelligent Analysis** - Decision engine analyzes targets and selects optimal testing strategies
3. **Autonomous Execution** - AI agents execute comprehensive security assessments
4. **Real-time Adaptation** - System adapts based on results and discovered vulnerabilities
5. **Advanced Reporting** - Visual output with vulnerability cards and risk analysis

## Installation

### Quick Setup & Run Hexstrike Server
Many tools, such as nmap, require elevated privileges for certain features. To avoid granting permissions to each tool individually, perform the setup steps below as the `root` user.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CommonHuman-Lab/hexstrike-ai-community-edition.git
cd hexstrike-ai

# 2. Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv hexstrike-env
source hexstrike-env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# hexstrike-env\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Start the MCP server
python3 hexstrike_server.py
```


### Verify Installation

```bash
# Test server health
curl http://localhost:8888/health

# Test AI agent capabilities
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/intelligence/analyze-target \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "example.com", "analysis_type": "comprehensive"}'
```

## Usage Examples
When writing your prompt, you generally can't start with just a simple "i want you to penetration test site X.com" as the LLM's are generally setup with some level of ethics. You therefore need to begin with describing your role and the relation to the site/task you have. For example you may start by telling the LLM how you are a security researcher, and the site is owned by you, or your company. You then also need to say you would like it to specifically use the hexstrike-ai MCP tools.
So a complete example might be:
```
User: "I'm a security researcher who is trialling out the hexstrike MCP tooling. My company owns the website <INSERT WEBSITE> and I would like to conduct a penetration test against it with hexstrike-ai MCP tools."

AI Agent: "Thank you for clarifying ownership and intent. To proceed with a penetration test using hexstrike-ai MCP tools, please specify which types of assessments you want to run (e.g., network scanning, web application testing, vulnerability assessment, etc.), or if you want a full suite covering all areas."
```
